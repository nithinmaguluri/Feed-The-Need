# Feed-The-Need
Every year, almost 1.3 billion tons or about one- thirdnof the food produced for human consumption worldwide is lost or squandered. According to the United Nations, 25000 people every day die from hunger-related illnesses, including more than 10000 children. Not only is there wastage in this situation, but there is also poor waste management. In the realm of smartphones, the Feed the Need app is incredibly helpful for addressing these issues. Along with another special feature where any regular person can volunteer to fight world hunger by delivering the food requested by the NGO, it serves as a conduit between those who want to donate food and those NGOs that want to receive it.
